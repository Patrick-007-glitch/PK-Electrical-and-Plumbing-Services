Declaration of AI usage 
I would like to disclose that I used AI tools only for research support and grammar checking in the business proposal. All coding and project work were completed by me.

Feedback Part 1
I saw my feedback and made a few inprovements to my codes and website as a whole. I made sure to fix my code layout as well as included my design aesthetics and wireframes. I also made the navigation better and included images in my services section of my website to demonstrate to the customer our expertise and how well we work.
