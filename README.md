Today is the 15/09/2025
I want to make some big changes to my website like by the services i want to include pictures for every service we do with a link which shows them the discription of what that term is i will make sure to include and cite my sources and i will make them lay next to one another. I will upload only the push the newly updated readme file unto github but i won't include the index file yet i plan to use java as well. It is 17:47 i changed my mind i want to improve the features by the services link which has the services that the company does mainly this feature will have a slide show and a link below it that has a discription of the service that we provide
