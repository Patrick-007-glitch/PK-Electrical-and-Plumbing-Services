I want to make some big changes to my website like by the services i want to include pictures for every service we do with a link which shows them the discription of what that term is i will make sure to include and cite my sources and i will make them lay next to one another. I will upload only the push the newly updated readme file unto github but i won't include the index file yet i plan to use java as well. It is 17:47 i changed my mind i want to improve the features by the services link which has the services that the company does mainly this feature will have a slide show and a link below it that has a discription of the service that we provide

I tried the slide show and it didn't work I tried using Getty Images as pictures in my website and use them as a slide show with no success i selected many images from the website and the website embeded them for me so that it is easier for me yo make them into a slideshow but it wasn't working so i decided to download images from a website called unspleash it allows me to download images for free and also it gives me references for each image i download.

Today i spent the whole day just searching for images to include in the website. I was using Unsplash but i changed to Pexels the picture is much better quality. I also spent this day to get the right referencing and citations. I also went through some website to see their layout and see if i can do something similiar I saw the layout of SARS (South Africa Revenue Service) and i really like it i won't do everything they did my will be a bit different i also made a new folder in my project where all my images will be i plan to start making improvement in my website/project tomorrow.
