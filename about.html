                      <h3>Our History</h3>
                      <p>PK Electrical and Plumbing Services was originally just a small company I created in my local community. Never did I imagine that it would grow this rapidly, and in just a couple of months. My name is Patrick Tshiluwa Kamunga. I am the owner of PK Electrical and Plumbing Services. Created this year, we have grown from a local service provider to a company located in the CBD of Cape Town, competing with big corporations for tenders in the electrical and plumbing industry.<br><br>
At the beginning of this year, I was just a normal self-employed handyman who just created a company. I had the experience, but I didn't have a team or employees. I was previously self-employed, and I know other electricians and plumbers who were mostly friends and colleagues I worked with in the past. I told them my vision and plans for this company I just created.<br><br>
Most were sceptical and refused; meanwhile, some liked my vision and joined my company without any hesitation. In just a space of 4 months, we had a team of 24 experienced electricians and plumbers working for PK Electrical and Plumbing Services. We gained recognition for our work in the community centre built this year, where our electrical and plumbing installation was praised.<br><br>
My goal for this company is to see it grow not only regionally but nationally as well.
