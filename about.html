      <p>
        PK Electrical and Plumbing Services was originally a small company created in my local 
        community. My name is Patrick Tshiluwa Kamunga, founder of PK Electrical and Plumbing Services. 
        Created this year, we have grown rapidly to a company located in the CBD of Cape Town, 
        competing with big corporations in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I worked as a self-employed handyman. I later brought together a group of colleagues 
        and friends with the same vision. In just 4 months, we built a team of 24 experienced 
        electricians and plumbers. Our work gained recognition when we completed the electrical and 
        plumbing installations for the community centre built this year.
